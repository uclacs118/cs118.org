title: "Using the Local Autograder"
---

After setting up your environment in [**Environment Setup**](/misc/setup), we
can now demonstrate how to use the local autograding harness. Make sure Docker
Desktop is running (or OrbStack if on macOS). If you haven’t already, clone the [**Starter
Code**](https://github.com/uclacs118/project0starter) onto your machine.

# Autograding
In the main directory, there's a `helper` tool we'll be using to interface with
the local autograder. To start, run `./helper run`. This will pull the Docker
image from our registry, build your submission (in the `project` directory), and run the autograding code.

After it’s completed, you’ll see JSON formatted output of your results. You
should be failing all the test cases since there’s only the starter code. See
[Autograder Test Cases](/projects/project0/#autograder-test-cases) for more info. 
This is also available in `results > results.json`.

You may also see the output of `stderr` for each run. Each file in the `results` directory 
will have the test case name (example: `test_self_ascii`) appended with either 
`refserver`, `refclient`, `yourserver`, and `yourclient`.

# Custom Testing
You may run each test case individually. For example, take this test case from
Project 0:
1. **Data Transport (Your Client \<-\> Your Server): Small, ASCII only file (10
KB)<br />`test_self_ascii` (10 points)**

To test just this test case, run `./helper test test_self_ascii`. You may test
compilation by either running `./helper test compile` or `./helper compile` (the
former runs the compilation code within the autograder and the latter just runs
`make`. Only the latter will show the compilation output).

Another way to run tests is to make your own. Run `./helper interactive`. This
will drop you into the autograding harness's shell. **Running `./helper
interactive` in another terminal window will use the same autograder-if you want
to test two binaries against each other, this is the best way to do it.**

In the `/autograder` directory, there are three important subdirectories.

One of them is `/autograder/source`. This is where all the autograding logic
resides. In the `src` folder, there are the reference binaries. Feel free to
test your solutions against them. 

Another is `/autograder/submission`. This is linked directly to the `project` directory on your local machine (any file you change in `project` changes in `submission` in the autograder and vice-versa).

The last one is `/autograder/results`. Just like `submission`, it’s linked to the `results` directory on your local machine.

# `helper`
We may want to update the `helper` script to add more helpful utilities. Run
`git pull origin main` to update it.
