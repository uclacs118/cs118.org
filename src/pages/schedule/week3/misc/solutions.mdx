## Activity 2: HTTP

Lines prefixed with `>` are inputs, lines prefixed with `<` are outputted by the program. The below only shows the communication over nc/netcat - assume there is a `nc 10.0.2.2 80` command before each one.

## Activity 3: DNS

For this mini-activity, we will resolve a domain name ourselves! In order to do this, we will use the `dig` command-line tool. **You MUST use the Google Cloud Shell at https://shell.cloud.google.com/?show=terminal, or else some questions are unsolvable.**

Using the dig command is simple:

`dig [@dns resolver] <query> [record type]`. `[]` are optional parameters, `<>` are required parameters.

For example, to lookup the `AAAA` record for `ctf.cs118.org`, you can use `dig ctf.cs118.org AAAA`. If you want to use cloudflare's DNS servers specifically (available at `1.1.1.1`), run `dig AAAA @1.1.1.1 ctf.cs118.org`. If you do not specify a record, `A` is used by default.

Let's start simple: what is the value of the `A` record for `dns.cs118.org`? 127.0.0.21, run `dig dns.cs118.org`

From 3.1, what is the IP address of the server that responded, and what transport layer protocol did it use? Respond like `IP:PROTOCOL`, like `127.0.0.1:ICMP`. 169.254.169.254:UDP, see under the server response for the IP and protocol.

What type of DNS server did we contact in 3.1 and 3.2?
1. Root
2. TLD
3. Authoritative
4. Recursive - CORRECT
5. Iterative
6. ISP

Now, it's time to resolve a domain from scratch! What is the type of DNS server we need to contact first?
1. Root - CORRECT
2. TLD
3. Authoritative
4. Recursive
5. Iterative
6. ISP

Alright! Let's get started.

The root name servers are available at `LETTER.root-servers.net` where LETTER is a letter `a-m`. Except since we are doing this manually, we can't resolve this. Instead, a text file with the IP address of the root DNS servers are distributed by hand to all resolvers that need it, and a copy of this file is attached.

What is the IPv4 Address of the Root DNS server that is hosted by USC's Information Sciences Institute, or ISI? 170.247.170.2 - look this up or look in the provided file for the "Former ISI.EDU" Name Server.

Let's query that server for `dns.cs118.org`, `A` record. What command should we run? `dig @170.247.170.2 dns.cs118.org A`, or any ordering of the last 3 arguments, and with/without the `A` argument.

Run the command! Wait, we don't get the `A` record back! Instead, we only get the record for `org.`. What DNS server type did we just get redirected to?

1. Root
2. TLD - CORRECT
3. Authoritative
4. Recursive
5. Iterative
6. ISP

Notice that in the authority section, we see that `org.` is redirected to some name servers such as `a0.org.afilias-nst.info.`, but in the additional section, we are also given the IP addresses of those name servers. What is the name of this technique? Glue or Glue Records

Let's use one of the name servers (pick any of them) and query it for `dns.cs118.org`. What is the resulting response? Answer in the format `RECORD_TYPE:RES,RECORD_TYPE:RES`, like `AAAA:127.0.0.1,A:0.0.0.0,TXT:1.1.1.1`. Run `dig @199.19.56.1 dns.cs118.org`, resulting in 2 records: `NS:dakota.ns.cloudflare.com.,NS:rose.ns.cloudflare.com.?`, dots at the end optional, and either order works.

Oops! In order to resolve this, and since we don't get the IP addresses automatically, we need to start over, but this time on the `.com` TLD. Go ahead and do this with `rose.ns.cloudflare.com` against the root DNS servers again. What is an IPv4 address of a TLD name server we can use when running the appropriate dig command? Run `dig @170.247.170.2 rose.ns.cloudflare.com`.

Let's try again: query one of the `.com` TLD name servers for the IP address of `rose.ns.cloudflare.com`. What is the `hostname` of a name server for the `cloudflare.com` domain? Run `dig @192.41.162.30 rose.ns.cloudflare.com`, resulting in `ns[3-7].cloudflare.com.?`

Now that we have the name server for cloudflare.com, *finally*, what is an IPv4 address for `rose.ns.cloudflare.com`? Run `dig @162.159.4.8 rose.ns.cloudflare.com`.

We're done! Right?

Oh right, we were resolving `rose.ns.cloudflare.com` just so we can continue resolving `dns.cs118.org` manually. Let's continue: resolve `dns.cs118.org` against the cs118.org name servers. What is the final result, and what is it's TTL? Answer in the format `IP:TTL`, like `1.1.1.1:100` Run `dig @108.162.192.141 dns.cs118.org`, resulting in `127.0.0.21:120`.
