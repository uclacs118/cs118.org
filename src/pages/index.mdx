# Course Overview
Using the Internet as a motivating example, in this class, we'll learn about 
many networking technologies. These technologies work together to facilitate 
communication between computers far and wide. 

A main focus of this class is the concept of *layering*, which is similar to 
*encapsulation*-each layer provides an interface in which the others don't 
concern themselves with exact implementation details. 

In this class, we'll go over a 5 layer model:
* Application
* Transport
* Network
* Link
* Physical

Through this model, we hope you'll gain an understanding and appreciation of 
protocol design and what considerations we take when deploying these protocols 
on a global scale.

## How to succeed in this course
The internet is a huge, complex collection of networks. As such, it's 
beneficial to *divide-and-conquer* it when studying. Figure out how many major 
parts there are and learn it one piece at a time.

Read the textbook and review the lecture slides. 
*Slides will be posted one day before each class.* Come up with questions and ask
them in class/office hours/Piazza. You'll have the chance to apply your 
knowledge in the homeworks and projects.

# Work Involved
## Projects
There will be **three projects**. 

0. The “zeroth” will help you set up your environment and introduce you to 
socket programming, 
1. the first will be a socket programming assignment that implements a 
reliable transport, and 
2. the second will be a moderately difficult assignment that does a makeshift 
version of Transport Layer Security (TLS). 


You will do all programs in C or C++17. Students are assumed to be competent in 
C or C++. Students not familiar will have to learn those outside the classroom.

**Project 0 will be done individually. Projects 1 and 2 may be done in groups
of up to 3.** Groups are allowed to have members across discussions. 

## Exams
There will be one midterm and one final. All exams are closed book, closed 
notes. You're allowed to bring cheatsheets: **one page** (both sides; sized 8.5x11 
letter maximum) for the midterm, and **two** for the final. This class is not 
about memorizing networking acronyms, but about understanding networking ideas.

## Homeworks
There will be **4 homeworks of about 5 questions each**. Homeworks will be 
released on Thursday of weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. They'll be due on Tuesday of
weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9. This allows for about ~1.5 weeks to complete each 
homework. **Homeworks must be completed individually.**

# Grading
In this class, we'll be following a strict grading policy. These rules apply
with absolutely no exceptions unless we have arranged otherwise (e.g. CAE).

- No late homework submissions will be accepted.
- There will be no makeup exams. Exams must be taken on the date that they're
  set.
- Project submissions will incur a **20% penalty** each day they're late. This does
  not scale continuously; if a project is due at 11:59 pm, submissions at 12:00 
  am the next day will receive a 20% penalty. As such, submissions that are 5 days
  late receive no credit.

## Boundaries
|||||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||**B+**|[87, 90)|**C+**|[77, 80)|**D+**|[67, 70)|||
|**A**|\[93, 100\]|**B**|[83, 87)|**C**|[73, 77)|**D**|[63, 67)|**F**|[0, 60)|
|**A-**|[90, 93)|**B-**|[80, 83)|**C-**|[70, 73)|**D-**|[60, 63)|||

Grade boundaries may (most likely) be relaxed, but will never be made stricter. 
A+ is reserved for top students.

# Miscellaneous
## Bruin Learn
All class material (worksheets, homeworks, slides, notes, etc.) will also be 
posted on Bruin Learn—separated by week in the Modules tab. You may also see 
your current class grade. Make sure to turn on announcements (whether via 
email or mobile push notification) to make sure you’re aware of any urgent 
class messages.

## Gradescope
Gradescope will be used to score all project, homework, and exam submissions. 
Projects will be graded with an autograder but also manually reviewed for 
sanity. You may access Gradescope by visiting our Bruin Learn page and clicking
Gradescope in the left-hand bar. 

**Regrades are allowed, but you may only request one regrade per question part.** 
If you’d like to contest any regrades, you must come to one of the instructors’ 
office hours. For exams and homeworks, there will be an announcement sharing 
the instructor that graded each question. Please visit that instructor’s office 
hours (you may visit any instructor for project regrades). If you cannot make 
their office hours, feel free to email them to schedule an alternate time.
Regrades are due exactly **one week** after grades are released.

## Piazza
For any quick clarifications that may benefit the entire class, our class is 
using Piazza to facilitate these discussions. Please email **all instructors** 
if you have more urgent questions. You may access Piazza by visiting our Bruin
Learn page and clicking Piazza in the left-hand bar. Note that you’re able
to make posts anonymously, but instructors will be able to see your identity. 

We're offering extra credit for Piazza participation. Up to **2%**, each 
instructor-endorsed answer will provide **0.1%** extra credit towards your 
total grade.

## Evaluations
We're also offering extra credit for course evaluations. You'll receive 0.75%
extra credit for filling out **both** the instructor and TA evaluations in
MyUCLA, and another 0.25% for filling out **both** the mid-quarter and
end-of-quarter LA feedback forms.

## Recordings
Lectures and discussions (1B only) will be recorded. The recordings will be 
available on Bruin Learn.

## PTEs
Due to operational reasons, we are unable to issue PTEs. Only the CS department
has the ability to issue them. If you have a pressing need to enroll in this
course this quarter, please visit 
[this website](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/enroll). 

## Academic Conduct
- **Usage of AI assisted tools**  
    You may not use AI assisted tools to complete any assignment. 
    While it’s certainly infeasible to prove the usage of AI assisted tools, 
    for projects, students may be asked about their design choices to probe 
    for understanding. Project related questions may also appear on exams. 
    Ultimately, the projects are designed to help you learn and apply 
    principles you learn in class.


- **Sharing Materials**  
    Do not post/share/sell class material, with or without answers, to anyone
    outside this class, during or after this quarter. For projects, make sure
    that your repositories (on a service such as GitHub/GitLab) are set to
    **private**. Keep them private during **and after** this quarter.

    As such, **the use of old material** to complete projects/homeworks/exams is
    strictly prohibited.

    As stated above, Project 0 is an individual project, and Projects 1 and 2
    may be completed in groups of up to 3. Collaboration beyond the sharing of
    general concepts (e.g. we used a linked list to store the receiving buffer)
    is also strictly prohibited. Note: Gradescope has a similarity checker that
    works just like Turnitin.

# Textbook
**Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach Featuring the Internet**, 
*Jim Kurose and Keith Ross*.  
This book serves as the basis for class content. It's highly recommended.
